# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
    - Somewhat confident - I'm still pretty slow when making the determination of the best option to output the desired results for each, but I'm getting better and I've got the basic function down quite well.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    - I very much enjoy stretching things and looking for the next step or an extra option - I've been doing exactly that from almost the very first assignment because it helps my learning process and I enjoy doing it.
    - I had quite a bit of productive struggle, in the Iteration Challenges especially, and learned several new methods as well as a pretty powerful reminder to keep things simple whenever possible.
    - I did have unproductive struggle several times, but in each instance it was only that I had missed a basic element of the function such as 'do' or a '?' in the right place, and taking a break and stepping back for a few minutes allowed me to spot the problem immediately on returning to work.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - I need to work on parsing through 'each' methods more quickly and becoming more comfortable with determining the best follow-up code to achieve the desired result efficiently. I'm going to go back through the practices and challenges a few more times and continuing to incorporate them wherever appropriate moving forward, and all of that is already baked into my calendar.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - I largely just have a few questions about best-practices and when certain expanded options might be appropriate, and I'll ask my TA the next time we have a call as it's far from an urgent concern.
